        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          For this assignment, I chose to examine checkboxes from three
          different applications. The three sources I chose were Google
          Calendar, Apple Mac Spotlight Search settings, and IntelliJ IDEA UI
          settings. I wanted to examine the different ways that users could
          interact with these components, and then think about revisions that I
          felt could be made to improve the design and user accessibility.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="images">
        <h2>Google Calendar</h2>
        <img src="images/gcal.png" alt="Google calendar states" />

        <h2>Spotlight Search Settings</h2>
        <img src="images/spotlight.png" alt="Spotlight search setting states" />

        <h2>IntelliJ IDEA UI Settings</h2>
        <img src="images/intellij.png" alt="IntelliJ IDEA UI settings" />

        <p>
          Each of these photos demonstrate applications with the same general
          functionality, yet there are key differences in the ways in which
          users can interact with them. I will highlight these below.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tables">
        <h2>User Input / Application Output Comparisons</h2>
        <h3>Inputs</h3>
        <img src="images/inputs.png" alt="Inputs table" />

        <h3>Outputs</h3>
        <img src="images/outputs.png" alt="Outputs table" />

        <p>
          Interestingly, despite key differences in the inputs and outputs from
          user interaction, the screen reader does essentially the same thing
          for all of the different applications. It alerts the user of the
          checkbox label as well as its status: checked or unchecked. The screen
          reader only reads when the user actually clicks, however. I would like
          to see expanded functionality where the screen reader reads based on
          hover state as well so the user knows where they are at in the boxes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="state-diagrams">
        <h2>State Diagrams</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the above observations, we can now create state diagrams that
          represent the flow of user input and application output. I will be
          focusing my diagrams around the Apple Spotlight Settings.
        </p>

        <h3>Mouse User</h3>

        <h3>Keyboard User</h3>
        <img src="images/keyboard-original.png" alt="keyboard user diagram" />

        <h3>Observations</h3>
        <p>
          With these state diagrams, there are some key changes I would like to
          make. For example, I think a hover effect should be added for mouse
          users. I also do not think it should matter where you click, the
          checkbox should always be toggled. Lastly, for keyboard users,
          pressing the space bar on an active box should toggle the checkbox.
        </p>

        <h3>Mouse User Revised</h3>
        <img src="images/mouse-revised.png" alt="mouse user diagram" />

        <h3>Keyboard User Revised</h3>
        <img src="images/keyboard-revised.png" alt="keyboard user diagram" />
      </div>

      <div class="revised-component">

        <h2>Revised Component</h2>

        <p>
          Based on my above state diagrams, I have chosen to modify the Apple
          Spotlight Settings as seen below.


          

          <ul>
            <li>New hover state so the user knows when it is over an element</li>
            <li>While not clear, space would now act the same as a mouse click for accessibility</li>
            <li>Clicking anywhere in region engages active state, toggling checkbox</li>
            <li>This means that mouse users cannot get the active state effect without toggling, but it makes it more accessible and easy to use</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Default</h3>

        <h3>Hover</h3>

        <h3>Clicked</h3>

      </div>

      <div class="reflection">

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The components I observed all had relatively minimalistic designs, making them easy to use and interact with. I tried to keep this in mind while redesigning, making sure that the componenet had a clear purpose. </li>
          <li>Apple Spotlight settings did not have any form of hover state or means by which a user could click on an element with the keyboard. I fixed this so that it should be easier for users to navigate and see which option they were over.</li>
          <li>I tried to address a "mismatch" in visual impairment with my hover effect, which makes it easier for users to know where their cursor is.</li>
          <li>The lack of "clicking" functionality on the keyboard for the Spotlight settings makes the settings inaccessible for keyboard users. On the contrary, I think that the hover effects present for both Google calendar and IntelliJ settings help users with visual impairment.</li>
          <li>Based on what I've observed, it seems mouse users are considered most when designing components. This may lead to missing functionality for other users; for example, Spotlight settings not even having a way to select an element with the keyboard. </li>
        </ul>
